Components
- add <body> element to pages and components; use it as actual <body>
  - you can't move the body element or add elements next to it, only inside of it
- no more <div> for components, just use the inner component content; fixes <ul><li> and align
  - when parsing component-children make sure to add a ref class if missing
    @todo to remove it later
- add component section in the right panel above the html section
  - this also includes the children element
- you can click any element even inside components
  - if you drag the element outside the component then it's moved there
  - if you bring in an element inside a component, then it's added
- component elements and everything inside will be violet in the sidebar, similar to figma
- have a toggle properties button above the file manager button (save it in settings file)
  - default is to see the property values
  - properties only apply to the current component and they are passed to children components
    if the property name(s) are matching otherwise not
    - check with react/angular if that's the case

- edit component in place
- create component from element
- detach component

- material design - create all components
- react/angular/vue - update npm packages
- check storybook integration and update all repos

Easier selectors
- rename to style
- add style
  - for checkbox/radio add [type="radio"] in the selector automatically
- add state
- add selector

Figma like snapping
- creating elements everywhere on drop positioned pixel perfect
- layout grid in background
- finish import positioning

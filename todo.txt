Components
- add <body> element to pages and components; use it as actual <body>
  - you can't move the body element or add elements next to it, only inside of it
- no more <div> for components, just use the inner component content; fixes <ul><li> and align
  - when parsing component-children make sure to add a ref class if missing; @todo to remove it later
- add component section in the right panel above the html section
  - this also includes the children element
- you can click any element even inside components
  - if you drag the element outside the component then it's moved there
  - if you bring in an element inside a component, then it's added
  - if you double click to change a component child text, you will change the component default text, not the instance property value
- change the component left sidebar icon to a diamond and show the full children tree
- you can right click and edit component in place
  - shows you the component properties as a list with name and default value
  - you can't add a new property here, but you can delete them or unlink them from all elements
  - to add a property, you need to select a component element and then click a button that will let you highlight the element text or an attribute name or value
  - once you highlight/click it then you see a dropdown to select the property name or create a new one
  - when you create a new property you can set the name, and depending on what you clicked it will also set its type/value
    - if you select the first srcset attribute, then it will only use value for the first srcset, not all srcsets; this attribute is a bit special, since it's a multiple value thing
    - if you select the "_blank" attr value from anchors, the value for it will be a default/yes/no button
    - if you select input type dropdown, then it will be that dropdown
    - you can only highlight things from the html section, including the custom html tag, except <option>s and <track>s
    - if you want to change the style, then attach a different class which will set the desired style
    - the first thing that will be attached will set the property type; if you use the same property name for a different type, then it will show an error, unless it's unlinked from all elements and in that case it will use that type
  - highlighted properties will persist to let you know which elements are linked to them
    - hovering over them, will show a tooltip with the property name
    - there will be a button to unlink and clicking the highlighted attribute will remove it
    - for the element text, there will be a place that says element text and you can highlight it
  - multiple elements can link to the same property
- when you select a component which has properties, you will see all them available in the sidebar and you can modify their value
- properties are not passed down from the parent to the children, they only apply to the parent
- react/angular/vue will use code like {{fooBar || 'Some text'}} for default properties
  - static has no change and will dump the default/set value

- edit component in place
- create component from element
- detach component

- material design - create all components
- react/angular/vue - update npm packages
- check storybook integration and update all repos

Easier selectors
- rename to style
- add style
  - for checkbox/radio add [type="radio"] in the selector automatically
- add state
- add selector

Figma like snapping
- creating elements everywhere on drop positioned pixel perfect
- layout grid in background
- finish import positioning

----------------------------------------------

Figma plugins/helpers
- generate text lipsum
- unicode + emoji table
- unsplash api, material design icons api, etc

Images
- resize/crop images
- drag&drop image from os to desech to create image
- drag&drop image from desech file manager to viewport to create image

Comments like in Figma
- integrate with git

Future
- remove unused refs on export
- start project from existing templates
- oauth microsoft
- electron, capacitor starter kits repos
- bitcoin payments + promote in crypto options websites

morphu notes

- multi select elements in viewport and sidebar (high priority)
- grouping/ungrouping elements (ctrl+g/ctrl+shift+g)
- variables placed in unit measure + left panel with variables
  - selecting a variable will show in the right panel the value to change
- import the layer grouping if the option is on
- prototyping like in figma

- project title in window title
- use figma pages/layers structure
  - abstract the html pages in the elements panel
  - default panel is elements not files
- viewport width/height per page not per project

- default + inherited values (check webflow)
  - maybe use input/autocomplete instead of select to show the inherited value
  
bugs:
- font Urbanist doesn't work in desech but works in the browser
- cut/copy/paste selector add it to right click selectors too
- copy/paste svg (google icon in desech) doesn't work
